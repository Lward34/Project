#FINAL REPORT: JQL SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

#TEAM 3: Lilian Ward, Jared King, and Quentin Stewart.

Overview of Project 

The group aims to develop a scientific calculator app capable of mathematical computations and metric/time conversion operations. The project’s purpose is to provide a high-end and accessible application for Androids that can be utilized for educational and related STEM purposes.  
Project Scope Statement
The major high-level requirements conducted for this scientific calculator app are:
•	The calculator can be installed and launched on Android devices.
•	Displays the values on-screen when the user presses the main buttons.
•	Handle the user’s invalid entries or possible errors.
•	Performs all the calculations and gives correct results.

We inspire to implement primary and standard elements of functionality, including:
•	Develop four conversion units: Imperial and Metric, Temperature (Celsius/ Fahrenheit), and Date/Years conversions.
